# Plotting Basics

### Motivation

Humans are very good at visual learning. Personally I learn much faster when I see things more than
I imagine it to be. The very quote <b>"what i hear i forget what i see i remember"</b> is the proof of 
this concept. So buckle up lets do some data visualization to help identify trends in datasets. I don't 
really need to say this unless you are living in a cave. This age is all about data and performing meaningful
operations of data. Welcome!

## Why plot data?

The very aim of the repo is to ask why possibly everywhere, but dawg it should make sense! don't ask 
why didn't I go to the gym today you gotta answer that for you. 

Lets come back to business data is plotted with an aim that it will give us visual 
insight without looking at the collection of numbers.

<b>Lets take an example:</b>

Consider the following, you are given an data collected from 
a lets say the humble temperature sensor.
